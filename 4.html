    <p style="color:slateblue">From its release in the first generation to the fifth generation, Charizard failed to make a major impact on the competitive scene,
    to the point where it "wasn't seen in serious competitive play"[21] and was "doomed ... to be forgotten".[22] This relative lack of viability, combined with 
    its relentless popularity, gave it an unfavorable "reputation of a Pokémon that represents the fanboys".[23] In VGC (Video Game Championship) the official 
    competitive format for Pokémon is a doubles format that started in Generation IV, and Charizard did not start to have much presence until it gained its Mega
    Charizard Y form in 2014 and 2015 where its ability Drought set up sun which could support its team members by activating abilities like Solar Power and 
    Chlorophyll and halving damage from water attacks whilst also boosting its already powerful Fire-Type moves, while also allowing it to use the move Solar Beam
    in one turn, when it normally took two, it could also help its team even more with Tailwind. However, in 2016 it fell from usage as Primal Groudon outclassed it
    as a sun setter and fire type. In 2017 mega evolutions weren't allowed and in 2018 it again had lots of usage until Primal Groudon outclassed it again in 2019.
    In 2020 mega evolution was not present in the newest games, Pokémon Sword and Shield, and so far it has been phenomenal with its incredible Gigantamax form with 
    the move G-max Wildfire which gives it a really strong damaging effect, even winning the Dallas Regionals. It got even better with its hidden ability being allowed
    with its Gigantamax form making it do 50% more damage when sun is up which is easier with Torkoal to make Charizard do more damage. Mega Charizard X hasn't been 
    nearly as good in VGC over the years with its ability being less useful and being weak to the common ability Intimidate however it has still seen some success with 
    people like Jamie Boyt winning a regional with this. In singles, it periodically found niches, such as with the boosting move Belly Drum,[22] but it was crippled by
    the fourth generation's entry hazard Stealth Rock, which removed half of its health upon entering the battle while active.[22][23] The sixth generation rescued 
    Charizard's competitive status by introducing its Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y forms, transforming it into a "top-level threat" of Smogon's standard tier.
    [23] With the release of Generation VIII and Pokemon Sword and Shield in 2019, Charizard gained more popularity with the new item "Heavy-Duty Boots", which negated the
    effects of Stealth Rock, it's previously mentioned major issue.</p>
